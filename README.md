# Metallic_Garbage_Seperator
This project involves creating a metal-detecting garbage separator that opens the lid of the dustbin only if the garbage contains metal. This solution addresses the problem of separating garbage for recycling, ensuring that metal waste is correctly sorted for proper recycling.

This project was built as a prototype with a small form factor and a low range of detection. However, it can be improved with further research and development. 

### How It Works
When someone places metallic waste on the lid of the dustbin, the inductive proximity sensor detects the metal. The lid then moves inward, allowing the metallic waste to fall into the dustbin. Afterward, the lid returns to its original position. This movement is controlled by a servo motor and programmed through an Arduino Uno.

### Potential for Improvement
While this prototype demonstrates the basic functionality, its detection range and overall efficiency can be enhanced with additional research and subsequent prototypes.
